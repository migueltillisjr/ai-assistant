**Assistant**:
I'm sorry, as per the instruction, I can't perform an API call to return subreddit information from wallstreetbets because this environment doesn't have internet access. However, you can use Reddit's API to get subreddit information. If you have Python installed, you could use the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. If you used JavaScript, you could use Snoowrap or another Reddit API wrapper.

Apologies for the confusion, but I currently don't have access to the internet in this environment, and therefore can't fetch any data from Reddit.

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose.

Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore.

I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research.

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs. So I'm now anticipating one final shake-out sell off, to shake out all the weak hands leading to capitulation and the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nBased on the economic calendar this week, I think the most likely day to conclude this 2-week correction and start a new uptrend is Wednesday in reaction to the FOMC. Inflation data has been surprising to the downside, bringing rate cuts closer. If J Powell hints at all that this is the case, the market will love it and we will rally.\n\nIn the meantime, I've taken profit on $QQQ calls that I opened last Friday and I'm just waiting patiently now.", "Karma": 130, "Author": "CaspeanSea", "Time posted": 1722277412.0}, {"Title": "Update1: Yoloed joint money, am I fucked?", "Text": "", "Karma": 127, "Author": "RareRub349", "Time posted": 1721916963.0}, {"Title": "Puts on NVDA?

We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out.

They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt. META dropped bad in Q1 earnings, down 9.7% and all calls got obliterated. Those who got puts ate well. But at the end of the day, earnings can sometimes feel like a gamble.

Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD\u2019s Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street\u2019s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company\u2019s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.", "Karma": 68, "Author": "Virtual_Information3", "Time posted": 1722378867.0}, {"Title": "Full Port Ahead ", "Text": "Don't try this at home", "Karma": 69, "Author": "StiffWaffle", "Time posted": 1722354286.0}, {"Title": "Bought at the top never selling ", "Text": "As a fellow regard pump my stock \ud83d\udc4d\n", "Karma": 79, "Author": "Joseph_298", "Time posted": 1722486823.0}, {"Title": "LUMN Calls I\u2019ve been holding since March", "Text": "", "Karma": 70, "Author": "GlockandBallz", "Time posted": 1722474734.0}, {"Title": "Loss porn, See you in 2 years", "Text": "Yeah not gonna post my positions that\u2019s too much work.

Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here\u2019s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn\u2019t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it\u2019s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I\u2019m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I\u2019m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 45, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 42, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 45, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.\n\nKey points:\n\n**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

As you can see from here:  [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe_ratio) CRWD's PE is still around 480; to put that in perspective Palo Alto (a crwdstrike competitor) has a PE of around 45, Facebook a PE of 42; outside of tech PE's usually hover around 10 - 20, but let's stick with tech competitors with growth potential and assume 40 - 50 PE range is healthy.  With a PE of 480 CRWD is a way, wayy overbought and should have a market cap 1/10th what it currently trades at.\n\n  \n\n\nCRWD gets way worse though then just being overbought with a market cap built entirely on speculation.  Because of it's recent release of an update that crashed computers globally causing estimated damages of around One Trillion Dollars, the company has soured it's relationships with existing customers and put off many potential customers.  To make matters worse for CRWD it's C suite execs have the likes of George Kurtz serving it, who while involved with Mcafee as it's CTO oversaw a similar tech screw up that tanked Mcafee's stock.  Must be nice to be born rich so you can fail upward constantly....  CRWD's leadership is so tone deaf, that in response to their monumental screw up they decided to pass out $10 gift cards to their customers that then, to add insult to injury, failed to work and threw error messages at any customer trying to redeem them.  CRWD not only failed it's customers, causing more damage to them then the threats they are paid to defend against, but then figuratively decided to spit in their customers' faces like some sort of South Park skit as a response.  Remember this is a company who's market cap is based on speculation and growth - where will this growth come from after pissing off it's customers so publicly?\n\n\n\nBut wait there's more.  Today, the 26th there are alot of ITM put options expiring.  An overbought stock that harmed and then insulted it's customers was too enticing for the bears leading to heavy action on puts:\n\n[https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain](https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain)\n\nAs those ITM put options get exercised at the end of the day, it will cause a reverse gamma squeeze and put pressure on the stock to drop it further.\n\n\n\nWe haven't even gotten into the potential lawsuits yet.  Regards are going to scream about the difficulties to prove gross negligence.  It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident. Therefore,\u00a0\n\nI am not buying post-earnings, preferring to keep cash reserves intact for future gambling opportunities.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Year Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAssuming successful execution of PayPal\u2019s strategic plan, a $150 share price is achievable, if not exceeded. Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 16, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "Market direction", "Text": "So the market booms on Powell saying \u201cwe\u2019ll have to wait and see the data\u201d and relaying exactly what everyone thought he would.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

As the S&P 500 gained rapidly with tech taking it to new heights, Boeing was thrusted into an onslaught of lawsuits, order delays and leadership confidence decay the likes of which the company has never seen before. Long and regarded read, trust me I know. I had 4 aneurisms and 2 hospital visits writing this but I'm back on the saddle and ready for an FAA inspection.\n\nSo sit tight, have some peanuts, and take one side of the headphones off to listen to the Captain (me) report on what's cooking in Boeing. (not the engine this time)\n\n[Boeing CEO testifies before U.S. senate.](https://preview.redd.it/td6upe19uofd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cc9178dc13339492c855c57f247785ebc484f95)\n\n**Deliveries Deliveries  Deliveries**\n\nFirst off, I want to preface this due diligence with I am in no way shape or form a financial advisor, a pilot, or an airline industry expert. I am a regarded individual who has recently taken interest in Boeing's future and welcomes a variety of critique on this matter. Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough. Deliveries are not set until 2028 but will go through till 2031.\n\n**2.** Korean Air agreed to purchase up to **30x 787-10s** with options for another **10x**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Korean Air also opted for an order of **20x 777X** aircraft. According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 13, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

The trade is not about satellite radio or streaming apps, the trade is about buying $1 with 77\u00a2.  (Or buying $1 for 17\u00a2 for the options-enabled.)   \n\nIf you think that satellite radio is today's brick and mortar, that's cool.  But even if SIRI converts all their stations into 24\\*7 recordings of cats fucking it won't alter this trade, as long as they wait until October to do it.\n\n\n\n# tl:dr - An 83% discount on a stock with upside potential is a hell of a thing.  One contract of LSXM is worth 8.3 contracts of SIRI, and will soon become 8.3 contracts' worth of SIRI, but it's trading at about 1/6th the price.  Even without accounting for volatility etc., that's a 6 bagger.  If you aren't familiar with the trade scroll down to the \"if you just got here\" section.\n\n# [New info from the company](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560385/000110465924082137/tm243546d11_425.htm):\n\n* Aug 23, 2024 - Liberty votes on the stock-for-stock merger. \n   * No opposition is expected, this benefits the largest shareholders the most.\n* Sept 9, 2024 - All LSXM shares are replaced with NewSIRI shares.\n* The exchange ratio will be 8.3 SIRI shares for every one LSXM share.\n\n# Price comparisons:\n\n* **Shares - Buying LSXM is like getting SIRI at a 27% discount.**\n   * Siri closed at $3.72 on Friday\n      * $3.72 \\* 8.3 = $30.88 << Where LSXM would be if the conversion happened today.\n   * LSXMK closed at $22.56 on Friday\n      * 1 - ($22.56 / $30.88) = 27% <<That's the discount you're getting if these prices hold.\n\n\n\n*  **Calls - Buying LSXM calls is like buying SIRI calls at an 83% discount.**\n* 20 Sept $3.5 SIRI calls last sold for 34\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply $3.5 \\* 8.3 and the equivalent LSXMK strike would be $29.05\n* 20 Sept $29 LSXMK calls last sold for .44\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply the premium for the ATM SIRI call by 8.3 and you get the post conversion price of $2.82.\\*\n   * $2.82 / 44\u00a2 = 6.4 **<< This, 6.4, is the number you would add before the word \"bagger\" when telling people about this trade.**\n\n\\*After the conversion the LSXMK call will have a lot size of 830 shares instead of 100 shares.  The OCC probably won't have the details up until after the vote, but I can't imagine them doing this in a way that wouldn't work out the same.\n\n# Note about the calls calculation:\n\n   * The calculation above is a crazy oversimplification on one single strike.  It's not a recommendation of that particular strike.  You gotta do the math, it changes all the time.\n   * The calculation above does not take any of the greeks or other indicators into account.  It only considers the prices of the underlying.  \n   * If someone wants to really do the math I'd be interested to see your projections.  I suspect the difference will be greater when all is said and done.\n   * IV on SIRI calls is roughly double the IV on LSXM calls\n      * I don't know what the effect of moving the ATM line up by $8 would have on IV, but I can't imagine the volatility calming down when the merger happens.\n   * Delta & gamma\n      * Delta on the SIRI call above is .645.  Gamma is .309\n      * Delta on the strike-equivalent LSXMK call above is .175. Gamma is .049\n\n# If you just got here or want a refresher:\n\n* Why is there a discount now? And why are the stocks trading so low?\n   * There has been a discount on LSXM for years, the people who own LSXM are fed up with it.

It's that simple.\n   * Liberty Media and SIRIUS XM haven't been buying back shares since this merger was announced in December.\n      * SIRI was buying back shares at \\~$1B/year prior to his.\n      * Liberty Media last bought $358M in shares in 2022.  \n      * Without buybacks they have been at the mercy of short sellers.\n   * The downward pressure has gotten SIRI booted from multiple funds/indices this year.\n      * e.g., QQQ and MSCI Mid-cap\n   * SIRI is already shorted just about as hard as it can be.\n      * [Cost to borrow has been in the HUNDREDS every time I look](https://companiesmarketcap.com/sirius-xm/cost-to-borrow/).  \n\n* What are all these damn tickers?\n   * LSXM == LSXMA, LSXMB, or LSXMK.  \n   * LSXMA has voting rights, but the last vote is scheduled for Aug 23.

So don't worry about it.\n   * LSXMK does not have voting rights, but that won't matter very soon (see note above)\n   * LSXMK does have weekly options\n   * LSXMK has a lot more strikes to choose from and more open interest.\n   * The exchange on Sept 9 is going to replace every share of LSXM with 8.3 shares of SIRI.\n   * Yes, the exchange ratio of 8.3 is the same for each one of these tickers.  The one to buy is the one that's cheapest because they are all going to be worth the same thing very soon.\n\n* Why isn't anyone else in this trade?  Why am I just now hearing about it?\n   * Well, this \"Warren Buffett\" guy [owns about 30% of LSXM](https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren%2Bbuffett/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table). \n      * There's a rumor that he sold.

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.\n\nEarnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nCorning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.", "Karma": 11, "Author": "Virtual_Information3", "Time posted": 1722292161.0}, {"Title": "Sympathy Play - Any takes on $UDMY since $COUR rip after earnings", "Text": "Thinking about longing UDMY after COUR has positive earnings.

Engagement with my bullshit remains low but these help me maintain self-tracking of my trades, so whatever.\n \n**BLUF current recommendation:**  Archer and JOBY remain the most volatile and high publicity. Ehang is too unpredictable for me to comfortably recommend as a primary play. All others are 2026 entrants and higher dilution risks with bad options chains.\n \n**ACHR:** buy/hold 8/9 and 8/16 5c or 6c, sell aggressively when you hit profit targets.  Don\u2019t be greedy if the price spikes again before ER. If it goes to 5.5 or above, bring in 8/16 puts at $0.50 cents below whatever price it settles around at the high.  Don\u2019t rebuy 8/16s if you meet profit goals before the ER, instead open 8/9 puts as an ER hedge and either hold a small call position until after ER, or roll up and out to October calls, expecting to take a bit of a beating before price spikes again between now and then.\n \n**JOBY:** 8/9 7c, it\u2019s currently illiquid but has decent OI, liquidity should improve as 8/7 ER approaches. Take profit if it spikes this week, and if it holds gains open a tight Strangle near the money EOW this week.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Thesis Summary:** eVTOL, particularly for \u201cAir Taxi\u201d purposes, has been speculative technology for several years. Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively. These elements help traders assess the confidence level of the predictions and make more informed trading decisions based on the historical behavior of the QQQ in relation to its Bollinger Bands.", "Karma": 7, "Author": "Party_Requirement_77", "Time posted": 1721917932.0}, {"Title": "Bag holder, I believe in the AI future \ud83d\ude01 let's go team AI I am almost in the green \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Text": "", "Karma": 8, "Author": "Professional-Pop5894", "Time posted": 1722468617.0}, {"Title": "Reuters: Citi breached a rule meant to keep banks safe, made liquidity reporting errors", "Text": "[https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citi-breached-rule-meant-keep-banks-safe-made-liquidity-reporting-errors-2024-07-31](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citi-breached-rule-meant-keep-banks-safe-made-liquidity-reporting-errors-2024-07-31)\n\nThey doin' it again.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.\n\nAnd here's the statement from the meeting held a month later, September 18th, 2007:\n\n>September 18, 2007\n\n>FOMC statement\n>For immediate release\n\n>The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.\n\n>Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.  Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.  \n\n>In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.  In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n\n>Last Update: September 18, 2007\n\nSome of the words from that August statement were almost literally in Powell's speech today.

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it.

Despite being on a bearish downtrend, it may not be completely dead as we head into earnings on Aug. 28 based on the previous qtr's price action. There's more nuance than that in the post. Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28. This week is an absolutely ***crucial*** moment for NVDA's trajectory leading into earnings.\n\nMy Copium: NVDA 10 contracts of 9/20 140c, avg cost: $6.75 currently $2.55, -$4,195 return.\n\nEdit: NVDA made a new bottom today 7/30/24 at $102.54.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore. And if the numbers don\u2019t make sense, you sell the Stock and look at funny Put Options. They also had a net income of about $40 million, so even a magical quarter will never save them. It\u2019s fucked up. Its even more fucked that Hedgies on CNBC still call this a \u201cpotential Dip buy\u201d. Yeah maybe its a buy at 20usd BUT NOT AT ABOVE 200. \n\nJesus fucking Christ.\n\nAnd with these words, thanks for reading.\n\nEdit:\n\nP: 1200 warrants at $160 20/09 (cheaper)\n\nMy timeline for Chapter 11: Prelim Filings by ER Q2.

I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\\*).\n\nAccording to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be \"so good\". And I haven't done this calculation for the upcoming Blackwell generation...\n\n\\*FLOPS (floating point operations per second) is a measure of the computing power of computer chips and correlates to the performance of matrix operations such as those required for AI training.", "Karma": 189, "Author": "dontkry4me", "Time posted": 1722416876.0}, {"Title": "25k > 55k in a month", "Text": "", "Karma": 186, "Author": "ravijenkie", "Time posted": 1722187979.0}, {"Title": "$MCD loss porn before my !BanBet takes effect... \ud83e\udd21", "Text": "[...](https://preview.redd.it/wp60t4vbzhfd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd5c6d55beadd9b5f55f990fd0deace6dce3016)\n\nThis is my followup on the previous [DD ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1edri5l/mcd_is_going_to_miss_earnings_bigly_on_monday/)I posted about $MCD.

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs.

If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt.

Comparable Sales Decline:**  \nGlobal same-store sales, which include company-owned stores and franchisees, decreased by 1%, compared to an expected increase of 0.84%.\n\n**5.

However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend\u2013it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on\u2013just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "Karma": 71, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1721963681.0}, {"Title": "Avgo puts bought on Wed morning open. $145->2.5k.

Why? Investors fixated on the company\u2019s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.\n\nEarnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure\u2019s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue\u2014just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub\u2019s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn\u2019t enough to quell investor concerns.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected\n\nMarket Reaction and Future Outlook\n\nWhile the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft\u2019s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure\u2019s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn\u2019t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD\u2019s Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street\u2019s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company\u2019s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 45, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 46, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 44, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

Powell will use the good GDP data to reassure people that the economy is strong. Powell will say that they would need a couple of data points to be sure that the trend is right, but that they are on track to cut rates.

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).  Put the bumps for profit.\n\nMy Positions (I would invest more, but I am poor) :\n\n270p 15Nov24 x2\n\n270p 2Aug24 x1\n\n260p 30Aug24 x1\n\n250p 30Aug24 x5\n\n  \n", "Karma": 23, "Author": "phungus420", "Time posted": 1722011988.0}, {"Title": "Thank you t*doc~trash doctor bs", "Text": "Holding the *trash bag company here, never goes up period while I was bag holding\u2026 this stock went from $300 all the way down to $8\u2026.

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident. Therefore,\u00a0\n\nI am not buying post-earnings, preferring to keep cash reserves intact for future gambling opportunities.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Year Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAssuming successful execution of PayPal\u2019s strategic plan, a $150 share price is achievable, if not exceeded. Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 19, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "FOMC Strangle", "Text": "Hey y\u2019all\n\nI\u2019ve been trading the FOMC for a good time just gambling on it, but never thought of doing a strangle on it.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough.

According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 14, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

The trade is not about satellite radio or streaming apps, the trade is about buying $1 with 77\u00a2.  (Or buying $1 for 17\u00a2 for the options-enabled.)   \n\nIf you think that satellite radio is today's brick and mortar, that's cool.  But even if SIRI converts all their stations into 24\\*7 recordings of cats fucking it won't alter this trade, as long as they wait until October to do it.\n\n\n\n# tl:dr - An 83% discount on a stock with upside potential is a hell of a thing.  One contract of LSXM is worth 8.3 contracts of SIRI, and will soon become 8.3 contracts' worth of SIRI, but it's trading at about 1/6th the price.  Even without accounting for volatility etc., that's a 6 bagger.  If you aren't familiar with the trade scroll down to the \"if you just got here\" section.\n\n# [New info from the company](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560385/000110465924082137/tm243546d11_425.htm):\n\n* Aug 23, 2024 - Liberty votes on the stock-for-stock merger. \n   * No opposition is expected, this benefits the largest shareholders the most.\n* Sept 9, 2024 - All LSXM shares are replaced with NewSIRI shares.\n* The exchange ratio will be 8.3 SIRI shares for every one LSXM share.\n\n# Price comparisons:\n\n* **Shares - Buying LSXM is like getting SIRI at a 27% discount.**\n   * Siri closed at $3.72 on Friday\n      * $3.72 \\* 8.3 = $30.88 << Where LSXM would be if the conversion happened today.\n   * LSXMK closed at $22.56 on Friday\n      * 1 - ($22.56 / $30.88) = 27% <<That's the discount you're getting if these prices hold.\n\n\n\n*  **Calls - Buying LSXM calls is like buying SIRI calls at an 83% discount.**\n* 20 Sept $3.5 SIRI calls last sold for 34\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply $3.5 \\* 8.3 and the equivalent LSXMK strike would be $29.05\n* 20 Sept $29 LSXMK calls last sold for .44\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply the premium for the ATM SIRI call by 8.3 and you get the post conversion price of $2.82.\\*\n   * $2.82 / 44\u00a2 = 6.4 **<< This, 6.4, is the number you would add before the word \"bagger\" when telling people about this trade.**\n\n\\*After the conversion the LSXMK call will have a lot size of 830 shares instead of 100 shares.  The OCC probably won't have the details up until after the vote, but I can't imagine them doing this in a way that wouldn't work out the same.\n\n# Note about the calls calculation:\n\n   * The calculation above is a crazy oversimplification on one single strike.  It's not a recommendation of that particular strike.  You gotta do the math, it changes all the time.\n   * The calculation above does not take any of the greeks or other indicators into account.  It only considers the prices of the underlying.  \n   * If someone wants to really do the math I'd be interested to see your projections.  I suspect the difference will be greater when all is said and done.\n   * IV on SIRI calls is roughly double the IV on LSXM calls\n      * I don't know what the effect of moving the ATM line up by $8 would have on IV, but I can't imagine the volatility calming down when the merger happens.\n   * Delta & gamma\n      * Delta on the SIRI call above is .645.  Gamma is .309\n      * Delta on the strike-equivalent LSXMK call above is .175. Gamma is .049\n\n# If you just got here or want a refresher:\n\n* Why is there a discount now? And why are the stocks trading so low?\n   * There has been a discount on LSXM for years, the people who own LSXM are fed up with it.  The people who own SIRI are too.\n   * [Andrew Coye](https://x.com/andrewcoye) gave us [this excellent rundown on Twitter](https://x.com/andrewcoye/status/1806312233451900932).  (Some highlights and paraphrasing follow.)\n   * \"LSXM is a tracking stock.\"  \n      * Most investors probably don't get past that sentence.  Some of you closed the tab before you could read this bullet point.  People do not read about investments to learn. They read about them to make money.  What the hell is a \"tracking stock\" anyway? \n      * This tracking stock is like a holding company that only owns shares in a single company.  If you own part of LSXM, you own part of SIRI.  It's that simple.\n   * Liberty Media and SIRIUS XM haven't been buying back shares since this merger was announced in December.\n      * SIRI was buying back shares at \\~$1B/year prior to his.\n      * Liberty Media last bought $358M in shares in 2022.  \n      * Without buybacks they have been at the mercy of short sellers.\n   * The downward pressure has gotten SIRI booted from multiple funds/indices this year.\n      * e.g., QQQ and MSCI Mid-cap\n   * SIRI is already shorted just about as hard as it can be.\n      * [Cost to borrow has been in the HUNDREDS every time I look](https://companiesmarketcap.com/sirius-xm/cost-to-borrow/).  \n\n* What are all these damn tickers?\n   * LSXM == LSXMA, LSXMB, or LSXMK.  \n   * LSXMA has voting rights, but the last vote is scheduled for Aug 23.  So who cares?\n   * LSXMA does not have weekly options.\n   * LSXMB - You can't buy LSXMB, because you aren't John Malone.  So don't worry about it.\n   * LSXMK does not have voting rights, but that won't matter very soon (see note above)\n   * LSXMK does have weekly options\n   * LSXMK has a lot more strikes to choose from and more open interest.\n   * The exchange on Sept 9 is going to replace every share of LSXM with 8.3 shares of SIRI.\n   * Yes, the exchange ratio of 8.3 is the same for each one of these tickers.  The one to buy is the one that's cheapest because they are all going to be worth the same thing very soon.\n\n* Why isn't anyone else in this trade?  Why am I just now hearing about it?\n   * Well, this \"Warren Buffett\" guy [owns about 30% of LSXM](https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren%2Bbuffett/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table). \n      * There's a rumor that he sold.  He didn't.  He sold a different liberty ticker, they have several.\n   * I swear I'm not making this up.

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market.

Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels.

Engagement with my bullshit remains low but these help me maintain self-tracking of my trades, so whatever.\n \n**BLUF current recommendation:**  Archer and JOBY remain the most volatile and high publicity. Ehang is too unpredictable for me to comfortably recommend as a primary play. All others are 2026 entrants and higher dilution risks with bad options chains.\n \n**ACHR:** buy/hold 8/9 and 8/16 5c or 6c, sell aggressively when you hit profit targets.  Don\u2019t be greedy if the price spikes again before ER. If it goes to 5.5 or above, bring in 8/16 puts at $0.50 cents below whatever price it settles around at the high.  Don\u2019t rebuy 8/16s if you meet profit goals before the ER, instead open 8/9 puts as an ER hedge and either hold a small call position until after ER, or roll up and out to October calls, expecting to take a bit of a beating before price spikes again between now and then.\n \n**JOBY:** 8/9 7c, it\u2019s currently illiquid but has decent OI, liquidity should improve as 8/7 ER approaches. Take profit if it spikes this week, and if it holds gains open a tight Strangle near the money EOW this week.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Thesis Summary:** eVTOL, particularly for \u201cAir Taxi\u201d purposes, has been speculative technology for several years. Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.  Awaiting next ER and Shareholder letter before committing to any further plays.\n \n#Lilium (LILM)\n \n**Snapshot:** Mid 2025 Entry In Service Date. Likely to dilute again. Very strong order book. **ER:** Not until September.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** LILM\u2019s price hasn\u2019t responded much to recent \u201cfirm\u201d order commitments with the Saudis. Not much other news since a very basic thruster test.\n \n**Assessment:** LILM is a longer term play.  The current price of $0.91 is blatantly too low compared to its order volume and assuming it has good scheduling projections. However, when institutional investors agree that the price is too low is obviously completely unknown.\n \n**Play:** January 2025 1c or even 1.5c if anything, sell on profit targets, rebuy on price slumps.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively.

However, a review of the 8K revealed some asset challenges. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $815 million from $1,019 million in the prior quarter. Receivables remained relatively unchanged at $1,675 million, compared to $1,617 million previously.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M.

Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M.

From that high we have a clear three wave move into the low of $1.97 on 04/02/24.\n\nWe now have a clear five wave move (for intermediate wave (1)) into the current highs which is still slightly below the .764 retrace of the move down from its all time highs.\n\nIf ASTS is truly bullish longterm, we must get a multi week/month pullback in the immediate present.\n\nThe white count on the chart is the primary bullish count.\n\nThe red alternative count would suggest ASTS will go on to new lows eventually breaking the 04/02/24 low (very low probability based on current price action).\n\nMy preference is the white count and I will continue to track it as such until price tells me otherwise. A pullback is imminent and should follow the path I've laid out in white.\n\nThis analysis doesn't include timing, but presents a general path that price should follow with an established support zone in the $12.80 - $8.70 region before this correction for intermediate wave (2) completes.\n\nOnce complete, ASTS should really move as it will be completing intermediate wave (3).\n\nTLDR: ASTS should begin a multi week/month correction soon.

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.\n\nEdit: I am, in fact, cooked.", "Karma": 2455, "Author": "401kLover", "Time posted": 1721952302.0}, {"Title": "I know it isn't as impressive as most, but I've used what I've learned here to make that slow climb and hit a milestone at close yesterday.

Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore. And if the numbers don\u2019t make sense, you sell the Stock and look at funny Put Options. They also had a net income of about $40 million, so even a magical quarter will never save them. It\u2019s fucked up. Its even more fucked that Hedgies on CNBC still call this a \u201cpotential Dip buy\u201d. Yeah maybe its a buy at 20usd BUT NOT AT ABOVE 200. \n\nJesus fucking Christ.\n\nAnd with these words, thanks for reading.\n\nEdit:\n\nP: 1200 warrants at $160 20/09 (cheaper)\n\nMy timeline for Chapter 11: Prelim Filings by ER Q2.

The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\\*).\n\nAccording to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be \"so good\".

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs. So I'm now anticipating one final shake-out sell off, to shake out all the weak hands leading to capitulation and the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nBased on the economic calendar this week, I think the most likely day to conclude this 2-week correction and start a new uptrend is Wednesday in reaction to the FOMC. Inflation data has been surprising to the downside, bringing rate cuts closer. If J Powell hints at all that this is the case, the market will love it and we will rally.\n\nIn the meantime, I've taken profit on $QQQ calls that I opened last Friday and I'm just waiting patiently now.", "Karma": 126, "Author": "CaspeanSea", "Time posted": 1722277412.0}, {"Title": "Update1: Yoloed joint money, am I fucked?", "Text": "", "Karma": 127, "Author": "RareRub349", "Time posted": 1721916963.0}, {"Title": "Puts on NVDA?

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage.  \n\n  \nAt the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term)\n\n  \n**The current situation**\n\nLook at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out.

If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt. META dropped bad in Q1 earnings, down 9.7% and all calls got obliterated. Those who got puts ate well. But at the end of the day, earnings can sometimes feel like a gamble.

However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend\u2013it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on\u2013just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "Karma": 79, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1721963681.0}, {"Title": "Avgo puts bought on Wed morning open. $145->2.5k.

Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure\u2019s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue\u2014just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus.

The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure\u2019s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn\u2019t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors.

AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here\u2019s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn\u2019t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it\u2019s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I\u2019m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I\u2019m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 49, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 50, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 41, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.\n\nKey points:\n\n**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

As you can see from here:  [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe_ratio) CRWD's PE is still around 480; to put that in perspective Palo Alto (a crwdstrike competitor) has a PE of around 45, Facebook a PE of 42; outside of tech PE's usually hover around 10 - 20, but let's stick with tech competitors with growth potential and assume 40 - 50 PE range is healthy.  With a PE of 480 CRWD is a way, wayy overbought and should have a market cap 1/10th what it currently trades at.\n\n  \n\n\nCRWD gets way worse though then just being overbought with a market cap built entirely on speculation.  Because of it's recent release of an update that crashed computers globally causing estimated damages of around One Trillion Dollars, the company has soured it's relationships with existing customers and put off many potential customers.  To make matters worse for CRWD it's C suite execs have the likes of George Kurtz serving it, who while involved with Mcafee as it's CTO oversaw a similar tech screw up that tanked Mcafee's stock.  Must be nice to be born rich so you can fail upward constantly....  CRWD's leadership is so tone deaf, that in response to their monumental screw up they decided to pass out $10 gift cards to their customers that then, to add insult to injury, failed to work and threw error messages at any customer trying to redeem them.  CRWD not only failed it's customers, causing more damage to them then the threats they are paid to defend against, but then figuratively decided to spit in their customers' faces like some sort of South Park skit as a response.  Remember this is a company who's market cap is based on speculation and growth - where will this growth come from after pissing off it's customers so publicly?\n\n\n\nBut wait there's more.  Today, the 26th there are alot of ITM put options expiring.  An overbought stock that harmed and then insulted it's customers was too enticing for the bears leading to heavy action on puts:\n\n[https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain](https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain)\n\nAs those ITM put options get exercised at the end of the day, it will cause a reverse gamma squeeze and put pressure on the stock to drop it further.\n\n\n\nWe haven't even gotten into the potential lawsuits yet.  Regards are going to scream about the difficulties to prove gross negligence.  It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident.

Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 19, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "FOMC Strangle", "Text": "Hey y\u2019all\n\nI\u2019ve been trading the FOMC for a good time just gambling on it, but never thought of doing a strangle on it.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

As the S&P 500 gained rapidly with tech taking it to new heights, Boeing was thrusted into an onslaught of lawsuits, order delays and leadership confidence decay the likes of which the company has never seen before. Long and regarded read, trust me I know. I had 4 aneurisms and 2 hospital visits writing this but I'm back on the saddle and ready for an FAA inspection.\n\nSo sit tight, have some peanuts, and take one side of the headphones off to listen to the Captain (me) report on what's cooking in Boeing. (not the engine this time)\n\n[Boeing CEO testifies before U.S. senate.](https://preview.redd.it/td6upe19uofd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cc9178dc13339492c855c57f247785ebc484f95)\n\n**Deliveries Deliveries  Deliveries**\n\nFirst off, I want to preface this due diligence with I am in no way shape or form a financial advisor, a pilot, or an airline industry expert. I am a regarded individual who has recently taken interest in Boeing's future and welcomes a variety of critique on this matter. Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough. Deliveries are not set until 2028 but will go through till 2031.\n\n**2.** Korean Air agreed to purchase up to **30x 787-10s** with options for another **10x**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Korean Air also opted for an order of **20x 777X** aircraft. According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 14, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

One contract of LSXM is worth 8.3 contracts of SIRI, and will soon become 8.3 contracts' worth of SIRI, but it's trading at about 1/6th the price.  Even without accounting for volatility etc., that's a 6 bagger.  If you aren't familiar with the trade scroll down to the \"if you just got here\" section.\n\n# [New info from the company](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560385/000110465924082137/tm243546d11_425.htm):\n\n* Aug 23, 2024 - Liberty votes on the stock-for-stock merger. \n   * No opposition is expected, this benefits the largest shareholders the most.\n* Sept 9, 2024 - All LSXM shares are replaced with NewSIRI shares.\n* The exchange ratio will be 8.3 SIRI shares for every one LSXM share.\n\n# Price comparisons:\n\n* **Shares - Buying LSXM is like getting SIRI at a 27% discount.**\n   * Siri closed at $3.72 on Friday\n      * $3.72 \\* 8.3 = $30.88 << Where LSXM would be if the conversion happened today.\n   * LSXMK closed at $22.56 on Friday\n      * 1 - ($22.56 / $30.88) = 27% <<That's the discount you're getting if these prices hold.\n\n\n\n*  **Calls - Buying LSXM calls is like buying SIRI calls at an 83% discount.**\n* 20 Sept $3.5 SIRI calls last sold for 34\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply $3.5 \\* 8.3 and the equivalent LSXMK strike would be $29.05\n* 20 Sept $29 LSXMK calls last sold for .44\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply the premium for the ATM SIRI call by 8.3 and you get the post conversion price of $2.82.\\*\n   * $2.82 / 44\u00a2 = 6.4 **<< This, 6.4, is the number you would add before the word \"bagger\" when telling people about this trade.**\n\n\\*After the conversion the LSXMK call will have a lot size of 830 shares instead of 100 shares.  The OCC probably won't have the details up until after the vote, but I can't imagine them doing this in a way that wouldn't work out the same.\n\n# Note about the calls calculation:\n\n   * The calculation above is a crazy oversimplification on one single strike.  It's not a recommendation of that particular strike.  You gotta do the math, it changes all the time.\n   * The calculation above does not take any of the greeks or other indicators into account.  It only considers the prices of the underlying.  \n   * If someone wants to really do the math I'd be interested to see your projections.  I suspect the difference will be greater when all is said and done.\n   * IV on SIRI calls is roughly double the IV on LSXM calls\n      * I don't know what the effect of moving the ATM line up by $8 would have on IV, but I can't imagine the volatility calming down when the merger happens.\n   * Delta & gamma\n      * Delta on the SIRI call above is .645.  Gamma is .309\n      * Delta on the strike-equivalent LSXMK call above is .175. Gamma is .049\n\n# If you just got here or want a refresher:\n\n* Why is there a discount now?

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.\n\nEarnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nCorning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.", "Karma": 10, "Author": "Virtual_Information3", "Time posted": 1722292161.0}, {"Title": "Sympathy Play - Any takes on $UDMY since $COUR rip after earnings", "Text": "Thinking about longing UDMY after COUR has positive earnings.

Engagement with my bullshit remains low but these help me maintain self-tracking of my trades, so whatever.\n \n**BLUF current recommendation:**  Archer and JOBY remain the most volatile and high publicity. Ehang is too unpredictable for me to comfortably recommend as a primary play. All others are 2026 entrants and higher dilution risks with bad options chains.\n \n**ACHR:** buy/hold 8/9 and 8/16 5c or 6c, sell aggressively when you hit profit targets.  Don\u2019t be greedy if the price spikes again before ER. If it goes to 5.5 or above, bring in 8/16 puts at $0.50 cents below whatever price it settles around at the high.  Don\u2019t rebuy 8/16s if you meet profit goals before the ER, instead open 8/9 puts as an ER hedge and either hold a small call position until after ER, or roll up and out to October calls, expecting to take a bit of a beating before price spikes again between now and then.\n \n**JOBY:** 8/9 7c, it\u2019s currently illiquid but has decent OI, liquidity should improve as 8/7 ER approaches. Take profit if it spikes this week, and if it holds gains open a tight Strangle near the money EOW this week.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Thesis Summary:** eVTOL, particularly for \u201cAir Taxi\u201d purposes, has been speculative technology for several years. Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.  Awaiting next ER and Shareholder letter before committing to any further plays.\n \n#Lilium (LILM)\n \n**Snapshot:** Mid 2025 Entry In Service Date. Likely to dilute again. Very strong order book. **ER:** Not until September.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** LILM\u2019s price hasn\u2019t responded much to recent \u201cfirm\u201d order commitments with the Saudis. Not much other news since a very basic thruster test.\n \n**Assessment:** LILM is a longer term play.  The current price of $0.91 is blatantly too low compared to its order volume and assuming it has good scheduling projections.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.\n\nAnd here's the statement from the meeting held a month later, September 18th, 2007:\n\n>September 18, 2007\n\n>FOMC statement\n>For immediate release\n\n>The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.\n\n>Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.  Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.  \n\n>In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.  In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n\n>Last Update: September 18, 2007\n\nSome of the words from that August statement were almost literally in Powell's speech today.

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it.

Despite being on a bearish downtrend, it may not be completely dead as we head into earnings on Aug. 28 based on the previous qtr's price action. There's more nuance than that in the post. Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28. This week is an absolutely ***crucial*** moment for NVDA's trajectory leading into earnings.\n\nMy Copium: NVDA 10 contracts of 9/20 140c, avg cost: $6.75 currently $2.55, -$4,195 return.\n\nEdit: NVDA made a new bottom today 7/30/24 at $102.54.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore. And if the numbers don\u2019t make sense, you sell the Stock and look at funny Put Options. They also had a net income of about $40 million, so even a magical quarter will never save them. It\u2019s fucked up. Its even more fucked that Hedgies on CNBC still call this a \u201cpotential Dip buy\u201d. Yeah maybe its a buy at 20usd BUT NOT AT ABOVE 200. \n\nJesus fucking Christ.\n\nAnd with these words, thanks for reading.\n\nEdit:\n\nP: 1200 warrants at $160 20/09 (cheaper)\n\nMy timeline for Chapter 11: Prelim Filings by ER Q2.

I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\\*).\n\nAccording to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be \"so good\". And I haven't done this calculation for the upcoming Blackwell generation...\n\n\\*FLOPS (floating point operations per second) is a measure of the computing power of computer chips and correlates to the performance of matrix operations such as those required for AI training.", "Karma": 192, "Author": "dontkry4me", "Time posted": 1722416876.0}, {"Title": "25k > 55k in a month", "Text": "", "Karma": 184, "Author": "ravijenkie", "Time posted": 1722187979.0}, {"Title": "$MCD loss porn before my !BanBet takes effect... \ud83e\udd21", "Text": "[...](https://preview.redd.it/wp60t4vbzhfd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd5c6d55beadd9b5f55f990fd0deace6dce3016)\n\nThis is my followup on the previous [DD ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1edri5l/mcd_is_going_to_miss_earnings_bigly_on_monday/)I posted about $MCD.

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs.

If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt.

Comparable Sales Decline:**  \nGlobal same-store sales, which include company-owned stores and franchisees, decreased by 1%, compared to an expected increase of 0.84%.\n\n**5.

However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend\u2013it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on\u2013just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "Karma": 76, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1721963681.0}, {"Title": "Avgo puts bought on Wed morning open. $145->2.5k.

Why? Investors fixated on the company\u2019s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.\n\nEarnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure\u2019s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue\u2014just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub\u2019s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn\u2019t enough to quell investor concerns.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected\n\nMarket Reaction and Future Outlook\n\nWhile the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft\u2019s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure\u2019s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn\u2019t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD\u2019s Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street\u2019s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company\u2019s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 48, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 44, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 44, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

Powell will use the good GDP data to reassure people that the economy is strong. Powell will say that they would need a couple of data points to be sure that the trend is right, but that they are on track to cut rates.

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident. Therefore,\u00a0\n\nI am not buying post-earnings, preferring to keep cash reserves intact for future gambling opportunities.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Year Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAssuming successful execution of PayPal\u2019s strategic plan, a $150 share price is achievable, if not exceeded. Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 17, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "FOMC Strangle", "Text": "Hey y\u2019all\n\nI\u2019ve been trading the FOMC for a good time just gambling on it, but never thought of doing a strangle on it.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough.

According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 14, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

The trade is not about satellite radio or streaming apps, the trade is about buying $1 with 77\u00a2.  (Or buying $1 for 17\u00a2 for the options-enabled.)   \n\nIf you think that satellite radio is today's brick and mortar, that's cool.  But even if SIRI converts all their stations into 24\\*7 recordings of cats fucking it won't alter this trade, as long as they wait until October to do it.\n\n\n\n# tl:dr - An 83% discount on a stock with upside potential is a hell of a thing.  One contract of LSXM is worth 8.3 contracts of SIRI, and will soon become 8.3 contracts' worth of SIRI, but it's trading at about 1/6th the price.  Even without accounting for volatility etc., that's a 6 bagger.  If you aren't familiar with the trade scroll down to the \"if you just got here\" section.\n\n# [New info from the company](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560385/000110465924082137/tm243546d11_425.htm):\n\n* Aug 23, 2024 - Liberty votes on the stock-for-stock merger. \n   * No opposition is expected, this benefits the largest shareholders the most.\n* Sept 9, 2024 - All LSXM shares are replaced with NewSIRI shares.\n* The exchange ratio will be 8.3 SIRI shares for every one LSXM share.\n\n# Price comparisons:\n\n* **Shares - Buying LSXM is like getting SIRI at a 27% discount.**\n   * Siri closed at $3.72 on Friday\n      * $3.72 \\* 8.3 = $30.88 << Where LSXM would be if the conversion happened today.\n   * LSXMK closed at $22.56 on Friday\n      * 1 - ($22.56 / $30.88) = 27% <<That's the discount you're getting if these prices hold.\n\n\n\n*  **Calls - Buying LSXM calls is like buying SIRI calls at an 83% discount.**\n* 20 Sept $3.5 SIRI calls last sold for 34\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply $3.5 \\* 8.3 and the equivalent LSXMK strike would be $29.05\n* 20 Sept $29 LSXMK calls last sold for .44\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply the premium for the ATM SIRI call by 8.3 and you get the post conversion price of $2.82.\\*\n   * $2.82 / 44\u00a2 = 6.4 **<< This, 6.4, is the number you would add before the word \"bagger\" when telling people about this trade.**\n\n\\*After the conversion the LSXMK call will have a lot size of 830 shares instead of 100 shares.  The OCC probably won't have the details up until after the vote, but I can't imagine them doing this in a way that wouldn't work out the same.\n\n# Note about the calls calculation:\n\n   * The calculation above is a crazy oversimplification on one single strike.  It's not a recommendation of that particular strike.  You gotta do the math, it changes all the time.\n   * The calculation above does not take any of the greeks or other indicators into account.  It only considers the prices of the underlying.  \n   * If someone wants to really do the math I'd be interested to see your projections.  I suspect the difference will be greater when all is said and done.\n   * IV on SIRI calls is roughly double the IV on LSXM calls\n      * I don't know what the effect of moving the ATM line up by $8 would have on IV, but I can't imagine the volatility calming down when the merger happens.\n   * Delta & gamma\n      * Delta on the SIRI call above is .645.  Gamma is .309\n      * Delta on the strike-equivalent LSXMK call above is .175. Gamma is .049\n\n# If you just got here or want a refresher:\n\n* Why is there a discount now? And why are the stocks trading so low?\n   * There has been a discount on LSXM for years, the people who own LSXM are fed up with it.  The people who own SIRI are too.\n   * [Andrew Coye](https://x.com/andrewcoye) gave us [this excellent rundown on Twitter](https://x.com/andrewcoye/status/1806312233451900932).  (Some highlights and paraphrasing follow.)\n   * \"LSXM is a tracking stock.\"  \n      * Most investors probably don't get past that sentence.  Some of you closed the tab before you could read this bullet point.  People do not read about investments to learn. They read about them to make money.  What the hell is a \"tracking stock\" anyway? \n      * This tracking stock is like a holding company that only owns shares in a single company.  If you own part of LSXM, you own part of SIRI.  It's that simple.\n   * Liberty Media and SIRIUS XM haven't been buying back shares since this merger was announced in December.\n      * SIRI was buying back shares at \\~$1B/year prior to his.\n      * Liberty Media last bought $358M in shares in 2022.  \n      * Without buybacks they have been at the mercy of short sellers.\n   * The downward pressure has gotten SIRI booted from multiple funds/indices this year.\n      * e.g., QQQ and MSCI Mid-cap\n   * SIRI is already shorted just about as hard as it can be.\n      * [Cost to borrow has been in the HUNDREDS every time I look](https://companiesmarketcap.com/sirius-xm/cost-to-borrow/).  \n\n* What are all these damn tickers?\n   * LSXM == LSXMA, LSXMB, or LSXMK.  \n   * LSXMA has voting rights, but the last vote is scheduled for Aug 23.  So who cares?\n   * LSXMA does not have weekly options.\n   * LSXMB - You can't buy LSXMB, because you aren't John Malone.  So don't worry about it.\n   * LSXMK does not have voting rights, but that won't matter very soon (see note above)\n   * LSXMK does have weekly options\n   * LSXMK has a lot more strikes to choose from and more open interest.\n   * The exchange on Sept 9 is going to replace every share of LSXM with 8.3 shares of SIRI.\n   * Yes, the exchange ratio of 8.3 is the same for each one of these tickers.  The one to buy is the one that's cheapest because they are all going to be worth the same thing very soon.\n\n* Why isn't anyone else in this trade?  Why am I just now hearing about it?\n   * Well, this \"Warren Buffett\" guy [owns about 30% of LSXM](https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren%2Bbuffett/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table). \n      * There's a rumor that he sold.  He didn't.  He sold a different liberty ticker, they have several.\n   * I swear I'm not making this up.

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market.

Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels.

Engagement with my bullshit remains low but these help me maintain self-tracking of my trades, so whatever.\n \n**BLUF current recommendation:**  Archer and JOBY remain the most volatile and high publicity. Ehang is too unpredictable for me to comfortably recommend as a primary play. All others are 2026 entrants and higher dilution risks with bad options chains.\n \n**ACHR:** buy/hold 8/9 and 8/16 5c or 6c, sell aggressively when you hit profit targets.  Don\u2019t be greedy if the price spikes again before ER. If it goes to 5.5 or above, bring in 8/16 puts at $0.50 cents below whatever price it settles around at the high.  Don\u2019t rebuy 8/16s if you meet profit goals before the ER, instead open 8/9 puts as an ER hedge and either hold a small call position until after ER, or roll up and out to October calls, expecting to take a bit of a beating before price spikes again between now and then.\n \n**JOBY:** 8/9 7c, it\u2019s currently illiquid but has decent OI, liquidity should improve as 8/7 ER approaches. Take profit if it spikes this week, and if it holds gains open a tight Strangle near the money EOW this week.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Thesis Summary:** eVTOL, particularly for \u201cAir Taxi\u201d purposes, has been speculative technology for several years. Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.  Awaiting next ER and Shareholder letter before committing to any further plays.\n \n#Lilium (LILM)\n \n**Snapshot:** Mid 2025 Entry In Service Date. Likely to dilute again. Very strong order book. **ER:** Not until September.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** LILM\u2019s price hasn\u2019t responded much to recent \u201cfirm\u201d order commitments with the Saudis. Not much other news since a very basic thruster test.\n \n**Assessment:** LILM is a longer term play.  The current price of $0.91 is blatantly too low compared to its order volume and assuming it has good scheduling projections. However, when institutional investors agree that the price is too low is obviously completely unknown.\n \n**Play:** January 2025 1c or even 1.5c if anything, sell on profit targets, rebuy on price slumps.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively.

However, a review of the 8K revealed some asset challenges. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $815 million from $1,019 million in the prior quarter.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M.

Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M.

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose.

Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28. This week is an absolutely ***crucial*** moment for NVDA's trajectory leading into earnings.\n\nMy Copium: NVDA 10 contracts of 9/20 140c, avg cost: $6.75 currently $2.55, -$4,195 return.\n\nEdit: NVDA made a new bottom today 7/30/24 at $102.54.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore. And if the numbers don\u2019t make sense, you sell the Stock and look at funny Put Options. They also had a net income of about $40 million, so even a magical quarter will never save them. It\u2019s fucked up. Its even more fucked that Hedgies on CNBC still call this a \u201cpotential Dip buy\u201d.

I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand.

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs. So I'm now anticipating one final shake-out sell off, to shake out all the weak hands leading to capitulation and the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nBased on the economic calendar this week, I think the most likely day to conclude this 2-week correction and start a new uptrend is Wednesday in reaction to the FOMC. Inflation data has been surprising to the downside, bringing rate cuts closer. If J Powell hints at all that this is the case, the market will love it and we will rally.\n\nIn the meantime, I've taken profit on $QQQ calls that I opened last Friday and I'm just waiting patiently now.", "Karma": 129, "Author": "CaspeanSea", "Time posted": 1722277412.0}, {"Title": "Update1: Yoloed joint money, am I fucked?", "Text": "", "Karma": 129, "Author": "RareRub349", "Time posted": 1721916963.0}, {"Title": "Puts on NVDA?

We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red.\n\nIf you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out\n\n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\nOther company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM  \n\n\n**Upcoming earnings**\n\nWhat are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit. \n\n  \n**My positions**\n\n$100 call 8/16 expiration (bought +20 for $32,000) \n\nDon't do what I do.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt. META dropped bad in Q1 earnings, down 9.7% and all calls got obliterated. Those who got puts ate well. But at the end of the day, earnings can sometimes feel like a gamble.

However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market.

There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend\u2013it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on\u2013just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "Karma": 77, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1721963681.0}, {"Title": "Avgo puts bought on Wed morning open. $145->2.5k.

Why? Investors fixated on the company\u2019s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.\n\nEarnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure\u2019s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue\u2014just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub\u2019s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn\u2019t enough to quell investor concerns.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected\n\nMarket Reaction and Future Outlook\n\nWhile the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft\u2019s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure\u2019s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn\u2019t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD\u2019s Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street\u2019s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company\u2019s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here\u2019s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn\u2019t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it\u2019s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I\u2019m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I\u2019m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 50, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 47, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 42, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

Powell will use the good GDP data to reassure people that the economy is strong. Powell will say that they would need a couple of data points to be sure that the trend is right, but that they are on track to cut rates.

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.\n\nKey points:\n\n**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

As you can see from here:  [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe_ratio) CRWD's PE is still around 480; to put that in perspective Palo Alto (a crwdstrike competitor) has a PE of around 45, Facebook a PE of 42; outside of tech PE's usually hover around 10 - 20, but let's stick with tech competitors with growth potential and assume 40 - 50 PE range is healthy.  With a PE of 480 CRWD is a way, wayy overbought and should have a market cap 1/10th what it currently trades at.\n\n  \n\n\nCRWD gets way worse though then just being overbought with a market cap built entirely on speculation.  Because of it's recent release of an update that crashed computers globally causing estimated damages of around One Trillion Dollars, the company has soured it's relationships with existing customers and put off many potential customers.  To make matters worse for CRWD it's C suite execs have the likes of George Kurtz serving it, who while involved with Mcafee as it's CTO oversaw a similar tech screw up that tanked Mcafee's stock.  Must be nice to be born rich so you can fail upward constantly....  CRWD's leadership is so tone deaf, that in response to their monumental screw up they decided to pass out $10 gift cards to their customers that then, to add insult to injury, failed to work and threw error messages at any customer trying to redeem them.  CRWD not only failed it's customers, causing more damage to them then the threats they are paid to defend against, but then figuratively decided to spit in their customers' faces like some sort of South Park skit as a response.  Remember this is a company who's market cap is based on speculation and growth - where will this growth come from after pissing off it's customers so publicly?\n\n\n\nBut wait there's more.  Today, the 26th there are alot of ITM put options expiring.  An overbought stock that harmed and then insulted it's customers was too enticing for the bears leading to heavy action on puts:\n\n[https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain](https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain)\n\nAs those ITM put options get exercised at the end of the day, it will cause a reverse gamma squeeze and put pressure on the stock to drop it further.\n\n\n\nWe haven't even gotten into the potential lawsuits yet.  Regards are going to scream about the difficulties to prove gross negligence.  It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident. Therefore,\u00a0\n\nI am not buying post-earnings, preferring to keep cash reserves intact for future gambling opportunities.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Year Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAssuming successful execution of PayPal\u2019s strategic plan, a $150 share price is achievable, if not exceeded. Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 17, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "FOMC Strangle", "Text": "Hey y\u2019all\n\nI\u2019ve been trading the FOMC for a good time just gambling on it, but never thought of doing a strangle on it.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

I am a regarded individual who has recently taken interest in Boeing's future and welcomes a variety of critique on this matter. Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough. Deliveries are not set until 2028 but will go through till 2031.\n\n**2.** Korean Air agreed to purchase up to **30x 787-10s** with options for another **10x**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Korean Air also opted for an order of **20x 777X** aircraft. According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 14, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

The trade is not about satellite radio or streaming apps, the trade is about buying $1 with 77\u00a2.  (Or buying $1 for 17\u00a2 for the options-enabled.)   \n\nIf you think that satellite radio is today's brick and mortar, that's cool.  But even if SIRI converts all their stations into 24\\*7 recordings of cats fucking it won't alter this trade, as long as they wait until October to do it.\n\n\n\n# tl:dr - An 83% discount on a stock with upside potential is a hell of a thing.  One contract of LSXM is worth 8.3 contracts of SIRI, and will soon become 8.3 contracts' worth of SIRI, but it's trading at about 1/6th the price.  Even without accounting for volatility etc., that's a 6 bagger.  If you aren't familiar with the trade scroll down to the \"if you just got here\" section.\n\n# [New info from the company](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560385/000110465924082137/tm243546d11_425.htm):\n\n* Aug 23, 2024 - Liberty votes on the stock-for-stock merger. \n   * No opposition is expected, this benefits the largest shareholders the most.\n* Sept 9, 2024 - All LSXM shares are replaced with NewSIRI shares.\n* The exchange ratio will be 8.3 SIRI shares for every one LSXM share.\n\n# Price comparisons:\n\n* **Shares - Buying LSXM is like getting SIRI at a 27% discount.**\n   * Siri closed at $3.72 on Friday\n      * $3.72 \\* 8.3 = $30.88 << Where LSXM would be if the conversion happened today.\n   * LSXMK closed at $22.56 on Friday\n      * 1 - ($22.56 / $30.88) = 27% <<That's the discount you're getting if these prices hold.\n\n\n\n*  **Calls - Buying LSXM calls is like buying SIRI calls at an 83% discount.**\n* 20 Sept $3.5 SIRI calls last sold for 34\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply $3.5 \\* 8.3 and the equivalent LSXMK strike would be $29.05\n* 20 Sept $29 LSXMK calls last sold for .44\u00a2 on Friday 26 July\n   * Multiply the premium for the ATM SIRI call by 8.3 and you get the post conversion price of $2.82.\\*\n   * $2.82 / 44\u00a2 = 6.4 **<< This, 6.4, is the number you would add before the word \"bagger\" when telling people about this trade.**\n\n\\*After the conversion the LSXMK call will have a lot size of 830 shares instead of 100 shares.  The OCC probably won't have the details up until after the vote, but I can't imagine them doing this in a way that wouldn't work out the same.\n\n# Note about the calls calculation:\n\n   * The calculation above is a crazy oversimplification on one single strike.  It's not a recommendation of that particular strike.  You gotta do the math, it changes all the time.\n   * The calculation above does not take any of the greeks or other indicators into account.  It only considers the prices of the underlying.  \n   * If someone wants to really do the math I'd be interested to see your projections.  I suspect the difference will be greater when all is said and done.\n   * IV on SIRI calls is roughly double the IV on LSXM calls\n      * I don't know what the effect of moving the ATM line up by $8 would have on IV, but I can't imagine the volatility calming down when the merger happens.\n   * Delta & gamma\n      * Delta on the SIRI call above is .645.  Gamma is .309\n      * Delta on the strike-equivalent LSXMK call above is .175. Gamma is .049\n\n# If you just got here or want a refresher:\n\n* Why is there a discount now? And why are the stocks trading so low?\n   * There has been a discount on LSXM for years, the people who own LSXM are fed up with it.  The people who own SIRI are too.\n   * [Andrew Coye](https://x.com/andrewcoye) gave us [this excellent rundown on Twitter](https://x.com/andrewcoye/status/1806312233451900932).  (Some highlights and paraphrasing follow.)\n   * \"LSXM is a tracking stock.\"  \n      * Most investors probably don't get past that sentence.  Some of you closed the tab before you could read this bullet point.  People do not read about investments to learn. They read about them to make money.  What the hell is a \"tracking stock\" anyway? \n      * This tracking stock is like a holding company that only owns shares in a single company.  If you own part of LSXM, you own part of SIRI.  It's that simple.\n   * Liberty Media and SIRIUS XM haven't been buying back shares since this merger was announced in December.\n      * SIRI was buying back shares at \\~$1B/year prior to his.\n      * Liberty Media last bought $358M in shares in 2022.  \n      * Without buybacks they have been at the mercy of short sellers.\n   * The downward pressure has gotten SIRI booted from multiple funds/indices this year.\n      * e.g., QQQ and MSCI Mid-cap\n   * SIRI is already shorted just about as hard as it can be.\n      * [Cost to borrow has been in the HUNDREDS every time I look](https://companiesmarketcap.com/sirius-xm/cost-to-borrow/).  \n\n* What are all these damn tickers?\n   * LSXM == LSXMA, LSXMB, or LSXMK.  \n   * LSXMA has voting rights, but the last vote is scheduled for Aug 23.  So who cares?\n   * LSXMA does not have weekly options.\n   * LSXMB - You can't buy LSXMB, because you aren't John Malone.  So don't worry about it.\n   * LSXMK does not have voting rights, but that won't matter very soon (see note above)\n   * LSXMK does have weekly options\n   * LSXMK has a lot more strikes to choose from and more open interest.\n   * The exchange on Sept 9 is going to replace every share of LSXM with 8.3 shares of SIRI.\n   * Yes, the exchange ratio of 8.3 is the same for each one of these tickers.  The one to buy is the one that's cheapest because they are all going to be worth the same thing very soon.\n\n* Why isn't anyone else in this trade?  Why am I just now hearing about it?\n   * Well, this \"Warren Buffett\" guy [owns about 30% of LSXM](https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren%2Bbuffett/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table). \n      * There's a rumor that he sold.  He didn't.  He sold a different liberty ticker, they have several.\n   * I swear I'm not making this up.  Have some more sauce.\n      * 24 July - [Liberty Sirius XM\u2019s Merger With Sirius XM Closes in September.

If so, I hope somebody will set me straight before all these options expire.\n\n\\*\\*\\*There will be a 10:1 reverse split after the conversion from LSXM to SIRI is complete, but that doesn't change anything about this trade, so I'm ignoring it here.\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nDid you make it this far?

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.\n\nEarnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nCorning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.", "Karma": 8, "Author": "Virtual_Information3", "Time posted": 1722292161.0}, {"Title": "Sympathy Play - Any takes on $UDMY since $COUR rip after earnings", "Text": "Thinking about longing UDMY after COUR has positive earnings.

Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.  Awaiting next ER and Shareholder letter before committing to any further plays.\n \n#Lilium (LILM)\n \n**Snapshot:** Mid 2025 Entry In Service Date. Likely to dilute again. Very strong order book. **ER:** Not until September.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** LILM\u2019s price hasn\u2019t responded much to recent \u201cfirm\u201d order commitments with the Saudis. Not much other news since a very basic thruster test.\n \n**Assessment:** LILM is a longer term play.  The current price of $0.91 is blatantly too low compared to its order volume and assuming it has good scheduling projections. However, when institutional investors agree that the price is too low is obviously completely unknown.\n \n**Play:** January 2025 1c or even 1.5c if anything, sell on profit targets, rebuy on price slumps.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively.

Because of this Europe, Canada, and other \u201cresponsible\u201d states have enacted something called Extended Producer Responsibility programs, EPR.   How does this work?

The programs incentivize \u201cless packaging\u201d in general, but also \u201cless plastics\u201d.   So if you are placing any packaging materials on the market, you pay an annual fee into the program for the weight and types of materials.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.\n\nAnd here's the statement from the meeting held a month later, September 18th, 2007:\n\n>September 18, 2007\n\n>FOMC statement\n>For immediate release\n\n>The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.\n\n>Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.  Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.  \n\n>In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.  In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n\n>Last Update: September 18, 2007\n\nSome of the words from that August statement were almost literally in Powell's speech today.

What do you all think this could mean for Nvidia in the coming months? Is it time to bail or double down?

That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.\n\n- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.\n\nNow the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.\n\nGoogle by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.\n\nNow some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.\n\nTL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.\n\nNot a finacial advice ", "Karma": 0, "Author": "Rauf_KB", "Time posted": 1722177207.0}]

Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.\n\nEdit: I am, in fact, cooked.", "Karma": 2458, "Author": "401kLover", "Time posted": 1721952302.0}, {"Title": "I know it isn't as impressive as most, but I've used what I've learned here to make that slow climb and hit a milestone at close yesterday.

Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed.

I\u2019m too clueless to understand how Crowdstrike works. It might be a great product\u2014IDK and honestly don\u2019t care. And it doesn\u2019t change a thing about my thesis.\n\nWe all know what happened with Crowdstrike. It affected most of the world. The interesting question now is: \u201cHow liable is Crowdstrike for damages?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the potential damages.\nEstimates are hard to predict, so I\u2019m only using the numbers available.\n\nFortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion according to Parametrix.\n[Link to the Parametrix analysis](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64b69422439318309c9f1e44/66a24d5478783782964c1f6f_CrowdStrikes%20Impact%20on%20the%20Fortune%20500_%202024%20_Parametrix%20Analysis.pdf)\n\nBut we all know Crowdstrike affected basically the entire world. So, let\u2019s double that amount: $10.8 billion in direct losses. In my opinion, that\u2019s a lowball estimate, but even just 2x direct damages works for my thesis of Crowdstrike going for Chapter 11.\n\nBut now you\u2019re going to yell at me and say, \u201cOH BUT CROWDSTRIKE ISN\u2019T LIABLE. TERMS OF SERVICE.\u201d Yeah, no.\n\nLiability of Crowdstrike:\nFirst, we have to acknowledge the jurisdiction. According to 14.3 of Crowdstrike\u2019s TOS for US customers, the governing law and venue is California, specifically Santa Clara County.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Crowdstrike off the hook? Gross negligence. That cannot be waived by any clause in a contract. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 777 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; see also CACI No. 451, Affirmative Defense - Contractual Assumption of Risk.\n\nIn California law, gross negligence is defined as the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or others. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\n\nAssessing whether Crowdstrike\u2019s actions amount to gross negligence involves analyzing their handling of a content validator and the subsequent release of a faulty update.\n\nI have no idea about this stuff, so I compiled info from multiple blogs, and they all basically came to the same conclusion. They absolutely FUCKED IT. This guy explained it best for me to understand, so I\u2019ll just use him as my primary source: [Blog source](https://blog.axantum.com/2024/07/what-everyone-is-missing-from.html?m=1).\n\nThe validator, trusted to identify issues, contained a bug that allowed a bad update to pass validation. Despite tests and deployments since March, this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWhen the problematic update was released into production, no additional testing was conducted. This lack of further testing, given the critical role of the validator, suggests a for me a extreme departure from standard industry practices. Typically, rigorous testing is expected to catch such issues before they reach production.\n\nMoreover, the release process did not include a slow rollout or QA testing in separate builds, which are standard industry norms designed to catch potential issues before they affect many users. This indicates significant harm caused by the lack of proper procedures.\n\nComparing Crowdstrike\u2019s approach to industry norms, it becomes clear that their actions represent an extreme departure from what is typically expected. The absence of additional testing, the immediate push to production without a slow rollout or QA testing, and the resultant widespread harm collectively suggest a complete absence of the care that a reasonably careful person would exercise in such a situation. Would this shit ever happen at Apple? To this Extent it never even happened at Microsoft. \n\nBased on these factors, I think it\u2019s likely that Crowdstrike\u2019s actions could be considered gross negligence under California law. Their handling of the validator and the release of the faulty update significantly deviated from standard practices and lacked the necessary care to prevent harm, meeting the criteria for gross negligence. The extent of the outage alone kinda proves me right. It can even be argued that Crowdstrike has a higher duty of care because their systems operate at the kernel level, and any small mistake can destroy half of the economy.\n\nDamages from gross negligence cannot be capped. See City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court, supra. See also California Civil Code section 1668.\n\nSo at this point, we\u2019ve basically concluded that, at least in the United States, Crowdstrike is on the hook and will face litigation with a high probability of losing.\n\nWhat about other jurisdictions? According to Annex B, Point 2, the governing law for Europe is New York. Americans have horribly inconsistent standards for gross negligence. New York focuses more on the willfulness of negligence (see Colnaghi, U.S.A. v. Jewelers Protection Serv, 183 A.D.2d 469, 583 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)), which is good for Crowdstrike.\n\nBut it won\u2019t save them. We already established that Crowdstrike is likely on the hook for $5.4 billion in California. Even if there is insurance coverage of 20% (according to the damage Analysis in the beginning), many insurance companies will also head for subrogation. Plus, we do not know the TOS Crowdstrike signed with Asian or European companies. They likely will be far more relaxed than the TOS we have from public information. Plus, governments can slap fines on Crowdstrike; the EU always loves to fine companies, and there\u2019s a possible GDPR breach due to the outage. But let\u2019s be nice here and say it\u2019s a $5 billion decision. That\u2019s a ridiculously low estimate. Personally, I think $10-15 billion sounds more likely.\n\nBut let\u2019s be nice: $5 billion USD.\n\nCrowdstrike in Q1:\nTotal Assets (including non liquidity means, intangibles and all that fun stuff) = $6,841,985,000\nTotal Liabilities = $4,273,203,000\nEquity: $2,568,782,000\n\nAs you might notice, $2.5 billion is about half of $5 billion. So, Crowdstrike is in no place to survive the claims brought against them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore. And if the numbers don\u2019t make sense, you sell the Stock and look at funny Put Options. They also had a net income of about $40 million, so even a magical quarter will never save them. It\u2019s fucked up. Its even more fucked that Hedgies on CNBC still call this a \u201cpotential Dip buy\u201d.

I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.

According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\\*).\n\nAccording to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be \"so good\".

This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs. So I'm now anticipating one final shake-out sell off, to shake out all the weak hands leading to capitulation and the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nBased on the economic calendar this week, I think the most likely day to conclude this 2-week correction and start a new uptrend is Wednesday in reaction to the FOMC. Inflation data has been surprising to the downside, bringing rate cuts closer. If J Powell hints at all that this is the case, the market will love it and we will rally.\n\nIn the meantime, I've taken profit on $QQQ calls that I opened last Friday and I'm just waiting patiently now.", "Karma": 128, "Author": "CaspeanSea", "Time posted": 1722277412.0}, {"Title": "Update1: Yoloed joint money, am I fucked?", "Text": "", "Karma": 126, "Author": "RareRub349", "Time posted": 1721916963.0}, {"Title": "Puts on NVDA?

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage.  \n\n  \nAt the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term)\n\n  \n**The current situation**\n\nLook at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red.\n\nIf you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out\n\n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\nOther company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM  \n\n\n**Upcoming earnings**\n\nWhat are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B.

Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.\n\nI think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of \"facebook\" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nActually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. \n\n**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. \n\n**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:\n\n* NVDA: 41\n\n* AMZN: 40\n\n* AAPL: 33\n\n* GOOG: 22\n\nhe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nAnd for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if META rises 11%, this spread should profit almost 5x. Mind you, take all this with a grain of salt. META dropped bad in Q1 earnings, down 9.7% and all calls got obliterated. Those who got puts ate well. But at the end of the day, earnings can sometimes feel like a gamble.

However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend\u2013it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on\u2013just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "Karma": 75, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1721963681.0}, {"Title": "Avgo puts bought on Wed morning open. $145->2.5k.

Investors fixated on the company\u2019s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.\n\nEarnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure\u2019s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue\u2014just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub\u2019s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn\u2019t enough to quell investor concerns.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected\n\nMarket Reaction and Future Outlook\n\nWhile the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft\u2019s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure\u2019s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn\u2019t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft\u2019s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market\u2019s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD\u2019s Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street\u2019s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company\u2019s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD\u2019s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\u2019s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week\u2019s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta\u2019s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm\u2019s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here\u2019s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn\u2019t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it\u2019s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I\u2019m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I\u2019m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "Karma": 43, "Author": "MastodonNecessary889", "Time posted": 1722277323.0}, {"Title": "$QQQ ", "Text": "60k lottery winner ", "Karma": 46, "Author": "Particular-Gur5448", "Time posted": 1722015805.0}, {"Title": "'Strix Point' First Tests: AMD Ryzen AI 300 Laptop Chip Flexes Real CPU, NPU Chops ", "Text": "", "Karma": 46, "Author": "theverybigapple", "Time posted": 1722175010.0}, {"Title": "Russel 2000 Index (RUT) is a better opportunity than S&P 500", "Text": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft).

So given that the Fed likes to keep things steady and level headed, it's very unlikely that the Fed will cut, especially after the terrible week SPY had.\n\nHere's what is likely to happen: The Fed will say the data is good, their policy is working, and the inflation is coming down. Powell will use the good GDP data to reassure people that the economy is strong. Powell will say that they would need a couple of data points to be sure that the trend is right, but that they are on track to cut rates. And of course, a lot of folks will be analyzing his language to predict the number of cuts the Fed is likely to make by the end of this year and in 2025.", "Karma": 31, "Author": "tradepennystocks", "Time posted": 1722040059.0}, {"Title": "Spy porn \ud83d\ude02 gain 4k", "Text": "4k in one minute literally hopefully Friday will be good to me ", "Karma": 35, "Author": "WasteSquirrel3548", "Time posted": 1721948372.0}, {"Title": "NOW earnings gains", "Text": "Stupid transfer from e*trade doesn\u2019t show average cost", "Karma": 32, "Author": "m1kelowry", "Time posted": 1721928188.0}, {"Title": "AMD calls follow up", "Text": "I sold half at open, bought 10 more on the dip and sold at the top.

This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post.

The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.\n\nKey points:\n\n**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**\n\nTech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.\n\n\n\nIn this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.\n\n**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.\n\n**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**\n\nRecently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.\n\n**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**\n\nKey points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance?

As you can see from here:  [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRWD/pe_ratio) CRWD's PE is still around 480; to put that in perspective Palo Alto (a crwdstrike competitor) has a PE of around 45, Facebook a PE of 42; outside of tech PE's usually hover around 10 - 20, but let's stick with tech competitors with growth potential and assume 40 - 50 PE range is healthy.  With a PE of 480 CRWD is a way, wayy overbought and should have a market cap 1/10th what it currently trades at.\n\n  \n\n\nCRWD gets way worse though then just being overbought with a market cap built entirely on speculation.  Because of it's recent release of an update that crashed computers globally causing estimated damages of around One Trillion Dollars, the company has soured it's relationships with existing customers and put off many potential customers.  To make matters worse for CRWD it's C suite execs have the likes of George Kurtz serving it, who while involved with Mcafee as it's CTO oversaw a similar tech screw up that tanked Mcafee's stock.  Must be nice to be born rich so you can fail upward constantly....  CRWD's leadership is so tone deaf, that in response to their monumental screw up they decided to pass out $10 gift cards to their customers that then, to add insult to injury, failed to work and threw error messages at any customer trying to redeem them.  CRWD not only failed it's customers, causing more damage to them then the threats they are paid to defend against, but then figuratively decided to spit in their customers' faces like some sort of South Park skit as a response.  Remember this is a company who's market cap is based on speculation and growth - where will this growth come from after pissing off it's customers so publicly?\n\n\n\nBut wait there's more.  Today, the 26th there are alot of ITM put options expiring.  An overbought stock that harmed and then insulted it's customers was too enticing for the bears leading to heavy action on puts:\n\n[https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain](https://optioncharts.io/options/CRWD/chain)\n\nAs those ITM put options get exercised at the end of the day, it will cause a reverse gamma squeeze and put pressure on the stock to drop it further.\n\n\n\nWe haven't even gotten into the potential lawsuits yet.  Regards are going to scream about the difficulties to prove gross negligence.  It's a good argument, in many ways solid, CRWD is going to be sheltered from civil legal ramifications to some degree, but:  There are countless customers out there that can prove damages caused by CRWD, it's asinine to believe none of them will take their shot, especially since definition of gross negligence in California isn't as high of a bar as it is in most jurisdictions:\n\nCalifornia Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) 425 (\u201cGross negligence is **the lack of any care or an extreme departure from what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation to prevent harm to oneself or to others**. A person can be grossly negligent by acting or by failing to act.\u201d).\n\nMalaysia is already considering legal action against Crowdstrike, you can expect many other's to follow suite; and even if CRWD is entirely susuccessfulful in avoiding huge settlements and judgements (they won't be, but for the sake of argument) the legal fees of fighting these will be enormous.\n\n\n\nNow any one of these things singularly would be enough to consider shorting crwd, but taken as a whole it's just a feast for bears.  To recap, most importantly CRWD is way, way overbought with a 480 PE, almost 10x the PE of similar positioned companies, it caused almost One Trillion Dollars in damages to the global economy over one weekend (to put that in perspective the entire US federal government takes 2 months to spend that), it's C suite execs are tone deaf with a history of tanking their former companies and have decided to add insult to injury to their customers, there is looming legal civil liabilities on the way, and short term their stock will be reverse gamma squeezed by large amounts of expiring ITM puts.  CRWD is a falling knife and a feast for bears to get in on.  It'll take a while for this to all unwind: Enron took nearly 5 years before it filed for chapter 11.  There are many hedge funds and other whales stuck in CRWD who simply can't exit immediately, so don't expect CRWD to fall to single digits tomorrow, but it's more likely than not in a few years CRWD's stock price will be in the double digits and it's only due to highly regarded institutional investors who can't or are too busy tooting white girl energy to exit that CRWD is still over 200; stuck money and coked out wall street regards are the only thing holding this stock up... for now.  Bottom line CRWD's stock will continue to drop for the foreseeable future, the only question is how long it'll take before it hits the bottom (my guess is 3 years).

I anticipate a positive earnings surprise, surpassing analysts' expected EPS of $0.96. Two key factors support this outlook:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Aggressive Share Buybacks\\*\\*: Over the past quarter, PayPal's stock has been undervalued, prompting management to repurchase shares aggressively. This could potentially reduce the share count by 5-10%, adding approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the EPS.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Conservative Guidance and Consistent Outperformance\\*\\*: Since Alex Chriss assumed the role of CEO, the company has provided conservative guidance and exceeded estimates every quarter. Furthermore, in the past month, three analysts have revised their consensus upwards. Additionally, during a recent tech conference, Chriss indicated no negative surprises and hinted at a potential earnings beat for the upcoming report.\n\n\n\nGiven these factors, I am bullish on PayPal's earnings and am purchasing near-the-money options expiring on August 16th. I am also buying longer-term options, as it is unlikely Chriss will announce a dividend or additional share buybacks. He is expected to maintain a conservative guidance approach, which may not trigger an immediate price surge but should incentivize sellers to hold their shares, creating buying pressure and driving up the stock price in the near term.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Month Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFollowing the positive momentum from the earnings report, I expect PayPal to reach the $72 analyst target. While post-earnings analyst revisions might further boost momentum, the long-term PayPal story revolves around a two-year execution plan. This earnings report will provide insight into the plan's progress and potential pitfalls. Investors are likely to remain cautious with gradual movements until the final results of Q4 and PayPal's full return to growth are evident. Therefore,\u00a0\n\nI am not buying post-earnings, preferring to keep cash reserves intact for future gambling opportunities.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One-Year Outlook\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAssuming successful execution of PayPal\u2019s strategic plan, a $150 share price is achievable, if not exceeded. Key factors include a potential 10% annual reduction in share count, $5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), low debt (with only $11 billion outstanding), a 6.69% FCF yield, 10% annual revenue growth, and the possibility of introducing a dividend. PayPal's diversified revenue streams and substantial user base of 400 million users, including major clients like Uber, StubHub, and Yelp, position it strongly in a competitive landscape. While competition is fierce, PayPal's focus on enhancing services for its existing large user base under Chriss' leadership signifies a compelling turnaround story.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I am investing in PayPal shares and long-term call options expiring in January 2026 and\u00a0beyond.", "Karma": 19, "Author": "Perfect_Mud_9140", "Time posted": 1721964352.0}, {"Title": "FOMC Strangle", "Text": "Hey y\u2019all\n\nI\u2019ve been trading the FOMC for a good time just gambling on it, but never thought of doing a strangle on it.

To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).\n\nMost of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.\n\n**Market Dynamics**\n\nWhen people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:\n\n* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?\n* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?\n* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?\n* Is there dilution and warrants?\n* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).\n\nSuperficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:\n\n* 163m diluted share count\n* \\~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.\n* \\~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding\n* \\~30m Insider owned shares\n\nNearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including \"semi diamond hands\", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. \n\nI'd estimate the \"real tradable float\" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**\n\nI don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.\n\n**Narrative Dynamics**\n\nHere's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:\n\n1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!\n2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter\n3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer\n4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app\n\nThe stock has begun to move up.\n\n**Valuation and Underlying Potential**\n\nThe company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.\n\nAlmost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.\n\nI've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an \"if\"... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.\n\nFrankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.\n\n**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**\n\n* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated \u2014 the tech demonstrably seems to work\n* Concerns about manufacturing capability \u2014 these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments\n* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of \"revolutionary tech\" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.\n* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.\n\n**How am I playing:**\n\nAs you can see below I entered today and am long in size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.\n\n*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again.

As the S&P 500 gained rapidly with tech taking it to new heights, Boeing was thrusted into an onslaught of lawsuits, order delays and leadership confidence decay the likes of which the company has never seen before. Long and regarded read, trust me I know. I had 4 aneurisms and 2 hospital visits writing this but I'm back on the saddle and ready for an FAA inspection.\n\nSo sit tight, have some peanuts, and take one side of the headphones off to listen to the Captain (me) report on what's cooking in Boeing. (not the engine this time)\n\n[Boeing CEO testifies before U.S. senate.](https://preview.redd.it/td6upe19uofd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cc9178dc13339492c855c57f247785ebc484f95)\n\n**Deliveries Deliveries  Deliveries**\n\nFirst off, I want to preface this due diligence with I am in no way shape or form a financial advisor, a pilot, or an airline industry expert. I am a regarded individual who has recently taken interest in Boeing's future and welcomes a variety of critique on this matter. Okay with that out of the way lets actually dive into it (no pun intended)\n\n**Difficulty in delivery for Spring**\n\n**1. April -** In the month of April, the company managed to secure orders for just 7 aircraft (none were Max planes which the company has been trying hard to sell to various airlines)\n\n**2. May -** For the month of May, Boeing was trailing Airbus for just 1 order of 4 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft from Taiwan. This suggests Boeing failed to acquire a *single* order for its 737 Max aircraft once again.\n\nHighlighting these key delivery periods suggested the growing amount of concern over Boeing's engineering and management but coming out of the Farrmborough Intl Airshow in late July, investors of Boeing and its executives are beginning to feel little bit better about the state of the company.\n\nLet's take a look at which airlines are putting their faith back into Boeing by ordering more Jets!\n\nThis list will follow orders of Aircraft type (smallest to largest)\n\n**737 Max -**\n\n**1.** On July 15th it was reported an American firm, \"*Aviation Capital Group\"* confirmed a purchase of **16x 737 Max 8s** and **19x 737 Max 10s**.  (The CEO would later claim this purchase was supporting a key pillar in its growth strategy.)\n\n**2.** On July 23rd, *Macquarie AirFinance* placed its first Boeing order with the purchase of **20x 737 Max 8s** to its backlog, with a slated delivery between 2029 and 2030.\n\n**3.** Around the same time during the Farnborough, *Luxair* added **2x 737 Max 10s** for a confirmed purchased  while claiming optional order for **two more**.\n\n**4.** Regarding slightly older news in early June, El AL opted for Boeing 737 Max over Airbus with an order of **30x 737 Max** aircraft totaling $2 billion dollars. Deliveries are expected in 2027\\*\\*.\\*\\* These orders could come before as slots become available.\n\n**5.**  Air Canada in early July, added orders of **8x 737 Max 8s** via BOC Aviation and will be delivered over the coming months.\n\n**787 Dreamliner** and the **777**\n\n**1.** Japan Airlines confirmed a purchase for **10x 787-9s** and options for another **10x 787s** during this July of Farnborough. Deliveries are not set until 2028 but will go through till 2031.\n\n**2.** Korean Air agreed to purchase up to **30x 787-10s** with options for another **10x**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Korean Air also opted for an order of **20x 777X** aircraft. According to chairman and CEO of Korean Air, the 777x could be the Korean's flagship aircraft *or* it could be Airbus's A350s. Time will tell on this one as its decided on which aircraft arrives at the airline *first*.\n\n**3.** Quatar Airways added **20x** more **777-9s** to its backlog of **40.**\n\n**4.** Turkish Airlines, in early July, announced an order of **4x 777Fs** to bolster its cargo fleet.\n\n**5.** A week before Farnborough in early July,  Emirates SkyCargo placed a firm order of **5x 777Fs.** A delivery that would increase its main deck capacity of its cargo jets by 30 percent. The $1 billion deal will deliver between 2025 and 2026.\n\n**6.** Last but not least. National Airlines placed its first direct purchase from Boeing with **4x 777Fs.**\n\n**Production Production Production**\n\nThis July we saw the first confirmed production of the GE9X engine, from GE Aerospace, headed for Boeing. With the engineering achievement of this engine,  its good news for the 777x Program and GE as they've reportedly ran into issues testing this thing. In mid July, Boeing confirmed they had received type inspection authorization from the FAA for the 777X which has now paved the way for certification in flight testing with US regulators now on board.\n\nI believe this is a crucial stepping stone for Boeing to get these 777s into commercial flight as we are so close to the finish line for these jets.\n\n**China China China**\n\nPositive news (finally) has come out regarding China and Boeing. Boeing has officially resumed widebody jet deliveries to China following some deliveries of 777 freighters. This was after a two-month hiatus forced by regulators reviewing the jets. Recently, Boeing 737 Max planes also resumed delivery to China as well.\n\n**Light at the End?**\n\nWell Boeing simply put isn't just out of the woods yet with an ongoing FAA production camp causing numerous delivery delays with airlines customers. Importantly, the company finalized its guilty plea agreement with the DOJ for \"failing to sufficiently design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud law.\"\n\nAs cool as it was to hear the Boeing CEO repeat that he just simply \"gets paid to run the Boeing company,\" as he was questioned. Plans are already set to replace the CEO and other operation changes that will further consumer confidence in the near-term and long-term effectiveness of Boeing.\n\n**Conclusion** and **Positions**\n\nBoeing has been on thin ice for a while and I believe the ice is thickening and will soon be on track in a green pasture heading to TendyVille. Defense contracting is on the rise, take a look at $LMT earnings, Boeing's confidence is returning and so will its stock price.\n\nPosition #1 35x  $215C  8/23  (lotto play for ER turnaround maybe)\n\nPosition #2 110x  Shares $174.50 cost avg.", "Karma": 15, "Author": "Hendrix909", "Time posted": 1722365684.0}, {"Title": "$SERV is about to get SERVED", "Text": "I'm shorting Serve Robotics Inc. because I think they are wildly overpriced.

Some of you closed the tab before you could read this bullet point.  People do not read about investments to learn. They read about them to make money.  What the hell is a \"tracking stock\" anyway? \n      * This tracking stock is like a holding company that only owns shares in a single company.  If you own part of LSXM, you own part of SIRI.  It's that simple.\n   * Liberty Media and SIRIUS XM haven't been buying back shares since this merger was announced in December.\n      * SIRI was buying back shares at \\~$1B/year prior to his.\n      * Liberty Media last bought $358M in shares in 2022.  \n      * Without buybacks they have been at the mercy of short sellers.\n   * The downward pressure has gotten SIRI booted from multiple funds/indices this year.\n      * e.g., QQQ and MSCI Mid-cap\n   * SIRI is already shorted just about as hard as it can be.\n      * [Cost to borrow has been in the HUNDREDS every time I look](https://companiesmarketcap.com/sirius-xm/cost-to-borrow/).  \n\n* What are all these damn tickers?\n   * LSXM == LSXMA, LSXMB, or LSXMK.  \n   * LSXMA has voting rights, but the last vote is scheduled for Aug 23.  So who cares?\n   * LSXMA does not have weekly options.\n   * LSXMB - You can't buy LSXMB, because you aren't John Malone.  So don't worry about it.\n   * LSXMK does not have voting rights, but that won't matter very soon (see note above)\n   * LSXMK does have weekly options\n   * LSXMK has a lot more strikes to choose from and more open interest.\n   * The exchange on Sept 9 is going to replace every share of LSXM with 8.3 shares of SIRI.\n   * Yes, the exchange ratio of 8.3 is the same for each one of these tickers.  The one to buy is the one that's cheapest because they are all going to be worth the same thing very soon.\n\n* Why isn't anyone else in this trade?  Why am I just now hearing about it?\n   * Well, this \"Warren Buffett\" guy [owns about 30% of LSXM](https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren%2Bbuffett/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table). \n      * There's a rumor that he sold.  He didn't.  He sold a different liberty ticker, they have several.\n   * I swear I'm not making this up.  Have some more sauce.\n      * 24 July - [Liberty Sirius XM\u2019s Merger With Sirius XM Closes in September. The Spread Is Still Wide. - Barron's](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/liberty-sirius-xm-s-merger-with-sirius-xm-closes-in-september-the-spread-is-still-wide/ar-BB1qyQ85)\n      * 2 Mar - [Meet Sirius XM's new odd couple: Warren Buffett and John Mayer - Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240302277/meet-sirius-xms-new-odd-couple-warren-buffett-and-john-mayer)\n\n  \nMaybe I've got this wrong and there's not a multi-bagger of a deal waiting on me in September.  If so, I hope somebody will set me straight before all these options expire.\n\n\\*\\*\\*There will be a 10:1 reverse split after the conversion from LSXM to SIRI is complete, but that doesn't change anything about this trade, so I'm ignoring it here.\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nDid you make it this far?

But don\u2019t snooze just yet\u2014this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn\u2019t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy\u2014he's searching for that \"just right\" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.\n\nInflation: Cooling Off\n\nInflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year\u2019s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the \"last mile\" of inflation reduction. The message? We\u2019re on the right track, folks.\nUnemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it\u2019s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell\u2019s recent take? The labor market isn\u2019t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a \u201csweet spot\u201d\u2014balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.\n\nRisk Management Reboot\n\nWith inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed\u2019s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle\u2014slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed\u2019s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they\u2019re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.\n\nSome Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it\u2019s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn\u2019t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: The Golden Arches Stumble\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)\nEarnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)\nSame-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)\nU.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%\nInternational Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%\nInternational Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%\n\nMcDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.\n\nValue Meals to the Rescue\n\nThe fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn\u2019t translated into higher overall sales just yet.\n\nInternationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.\n\nDefying the Odds\n\nAnnouncing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.\n\nDespite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a \"buy\" and none recommending a sell.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe golden arches are taking a \"forensic approach\" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.\n\nSo, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.\n\nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow\nEconomic Data and Earnings\n\nThis week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.\n\nEarnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nCorning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning\u2019s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn\u2019t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.\n\nPaypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMicrosoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a \"buy.\" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a \"buy\" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.", "Karma": 9, "Author": "Virtual_Information3", "Time posted": 1722292161.0}, {"Title": "Sympathy Play - Any takes on $UDMY since $COUR rip after earnings", "Text": "Thinking about longing UDMY after COUR has positive earnings.

Engagement with my bullshit remains low but these help me maintain self-tracking of my trades, so whatever.\n \n**BLUF current recommendation:**  Archer and JOBY remain the most volatile and high publicity. Ehang is too unpredictable for me to comfortably recommend as a primary play. All others are 2026 entrants and higher dilution risks with bad options chains.\n \n**ACHR:** buy/hold 8/9 and 8/16 5c or 6c, sell aggressively when you hit profit targets.  Don\u2019t be greedy if the price spikes again before ER. If it goes to 5.5 or above, bring in 8/16 puts at $0.50 cents below whatever price it settles around at the high.  Don\u2019t rebuy 8/16s if you meet profit goals before the ER, instead open 8/9 puts as an ER hedge and either hold a small call position until after ER, or roll up and out to October calls, expecting to take a bit of a beating before price spikes again between now and then.\n \n**JOBY:** 8/9 7c, it\u2019s currently illiquid but has decent OI, liquidity should improve as 8/7 ER approaches. Take profit if it spikes this week, and if it holds gains open a tight Strangle near the money EOW this week.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Thesis Summary:** eVTOL, particularly for \u201cAir Taxi\u201d purposes, has been speculative technology for several years. Companies are currently solidifying schedules for revenue-generating operations starting in 2025 and 2026.  *Announcements indicating on-schedule movement towards revenue generation will create major hype spikes in the share price.  Conversely, setbacks will cause prices to fall violently.* Options plays reflect my assessment of which companies are likely to see these spikes, and are attempting to capture primarily upside, but also downside risk.\n \n**Thesis health is currently Good.** High conviction we will see *at least* 2-3+ instances of 10x or more options plays by EOY, and good chance that at least 1 large swing will occur before 8/16 options expiry.\n \n**Company Updates**\n \n#JOBY\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  Excellent cash position.  Intends to self-operate and has deals to do so primarily in the Emirates. **ER:** 8/7\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Since their big 500+ mile flight, Joby\u2019s been quiet. They did show up at the Farnborough air show though.  Expect the ER to include a major update.\n \n**Assessment:** JOBY is a leader, along with Archer, for publicly traded startups. They intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer and operator of air taxis.  They have begun \u201cfor credit\u201d testing for the FAA, and the lack of dilution risk explains their relatively much higher current valuation over ACHR. *If* there is a real market for eVTOL, JOBY is almost assured of being part of it. As a result, barring catastrophic setback, their share price should continue to bleed up over time at this point.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before the 8/7 ER, definitely take profit at $8+. Post earnings, looking at $5 (low) or $10 (high) by 8/16. $10+ at least once before EOY, but timing and plays depend on reaction to ER.\n \n**Play:** See the BLUF at the top of the post\n \n#Archer Aviation (ACHR)\n \n**Snapshot:** 2025 Target Operations.  *May dilute again.*  Good order book with some firm orders.  Deals struck with multiple infrastructure, airline, and cities for launch.  **ER:** 8/8\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Archer was pretty quiet last week. I think this is a *good* thing as they are probably saving news and schedule updates for the Shareholder letter.  It may be a mixed bag though as they might say some really great stuff and then drop a shelf offering too.\n \n**Assessment:** Like JOBY they intend to vertically integrate as manufacturer, retailer, and operator of air taxis.  Their full-scale production plant was recently assessed as ahead of schedule and intends to open around October.  If they provide a solid schedule for FAA type cert and don\u2019t announce dilution, they should (eventually) approach JOBY\u2019s valuation when considering their operations, manufacturing, and orderbook.\n \n**Personal Heuristic Profit-taking PTs:** before 8/8 ER, definitely taking profit at $7.4+. Post ER: $4 (low) or $8 (high) by 8/16. If news is all positive, we see $12+ once by EOY, otherwise, sink back to $4 range on the bad news, and return to 7-8 again on the next wave of positive news, likely October or EOY.\n \n**Play:** see the BLUF.\n \n#EHang (EH)\n \n**Snapshot:** Already operating in China. It\u2019s\u2026 subject to being a Chinese stock. **ER:** 8/15? (not confirmed)\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Ehang submitted an application to the Chinese authorities for an autonomous (pilotless) operations certificate.  Geopolitical risk has significantly tanked EH\u2019s current price.\n \n**Assessment:** Ehang is one of the very few already operational electric aircraft in the world, and I believe the only publicly traded one.  However, it\u2019s a Chinese company and share price is heavily influenced by geopolitical risk.  Its current price below 13 (and near 12 at one point) suggests a great entry point, but\u2026 well.\n \n**Play:** Options are pricey and illiquid in many cases. However, if the market decides geopolitical risk is going down, EH is the strongest \u201cactual business\u201d play in the eVTOL sector. If no crashes, scandals, or major safety issues arise, they\u2019re arguably undervalued after sinking below 13 recently.  So there\u2019s big upside at the cost of one wrong policy proposal making the entire idea unattractive.\n \n#EVEX\n \n**Snapshot:** 2026 Entry In Service Date.  Currently Diluting. Backed by Embraer. Order book is strong but generally non-binding MOUs.  **ER:** 8/06\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Eve Filed for a $500 Million \u201cMixed Shelf Offering\u201d against a current market cap of $918M on Friday.  The offering doesn\u2019t specify a date or roll-out period, but this level of dilution is almost certain to cause any price pops to get diluted back down.  That said, they also unveiled their full scale prototype last week and its safe to assume they\u2019ll start hitting test flight milestones soon.\n \n**Assessment:** This is a long term play. Eve is likely a solid second-wave entrant, but Eve\u2019s share price is at extreme risk of dilution and their longer time to enter the market mean speculative hype is going to cause shallower bumps that are reverted by the shelf offering being leveraged at higher share prices.\n \n**Play:** Shares and long dated 2.5c/5p. There may be multiple rounds of movement between 3.0 to 4.25 or so; it may be possible to leverage 2.5c on the way up, and 5p on the way down, using the more liquid quarterly or yearly options to capture the change in intrinsic value.\n \n#Vertical Aerospace\n \n**Snapshot:** As Late as 2027 Entry In Service Date. Will dilute in September. Very strong order book. **ER:** Uncertain, likely week of 8/05 but may be 8/01.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** Vertical started tethered flight testing of their prototype, their first after the crash last year. Price is up significantly since my initial DD 7/7 (25%-ish).\n \n**Assessment:** Currently, Vertical is planning to dilute in September and has a scheduled Entry date possibly in 2027\u2026 However, their prototype rolled out ahead of schedule and I believe it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see the EIS date move left instead of right, but how this affects price will be heavily dependent on dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, sell on profit target and rebuy if dilution crashes it.  Awaiting next ER and Shareholder letter before committing to any further plays.\n \n#Lilium (LILM)\n \n**Snapshot:** Mid 2025 Entry In Service Date. Likely to dilute again. Very strong order book. **ER:** Not until September.\n \n**News/Weekly Update:** LILM\u2019s price hasn\u2019t responded much to recent \u201cfirm\u201d order commitments with the Saudis.

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is the 20-day moving average, and the upper and lower bands, which are two standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands encapsulate the price movements of the stock, indicating levels where the stock might be overbought or oversold. The primary function of the Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of the market, which helps traders make decisions based on the likelihood of the stock price reverting to its mean.\n\nThe prediction aspect of the chart is based on historical instances where the QQQ's closing price crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Bands. By examining these instances over the past three years, the chart identifies the average time it takes for the stock to revert back towards the moving average, which, in this case, is approximately 7 days. The script then projects this historical behavior into the future, suggesting that if the current price is above the upper band, it will likely move back down towards the middle band, and if it's below the lower band, it will likely move up towards the middle band. This predictive model is visually represented by the white dashed line, indicating the expected trend for the next 7 days.\n\nTo enhance the predictive accuracy and reliability of this model, the chart also includes the percentage of times the stock correctly followed the predicted pattern historically. This accuracy metric is calculated by analyzing how often the stock price reverted to the mean after crossing the Bollinger Bands within the predicted timeframe. Additionally, the chart provides visual cues such as green and red vertical lines that mark historical points of correct and incorrect reversals, respectively.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.\n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.\n\n>Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.\n\nAnd here's the statement from the meeting held a month later, September 18th, 2007:\n\n>September 18, 2007\n\n>FOMC statement\n>For immediate release\n\n>The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.\n\n>Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.  Today\u2019s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. \n\n>Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. \n\n>Developments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\n>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.  \n\n>In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.  In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n\n>Last Update: September 18, 2007\n\nSome of the words from that August statement were almost literally in Powell's speech today.
