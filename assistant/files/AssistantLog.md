**User:** `return subreddit information from wallstreetbets`

**Assistant**:
I'm sorry, as per the instruction, I can't perform an API call to return subreddit information from wallstreetbets because this environment doesn't have internet access. However, you can use Reddit's API to get subreddit information. If you have Python installed, you could use the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. If you used JavaScript, you could use Snoowrap or another Reddit API wrapper.

**Assistant**:
Apologies for the confusion, but I currently don't have access to the internet in this environment, and therefore can't fetch any data from Reddit. I also want to clarify the instructions; you asked me to translate dates into a specific format and respond in JSON format, but it seems your current request doesn't relate to that. Could you provide some additional context?
